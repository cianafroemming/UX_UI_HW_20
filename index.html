          <p class="lead">Drawing from insights gathered during user research, the “I Like, I Want, I Wish” exercise helped us brainstorm app features tailored to meet user needs and aspirations in meal planning and cooking.
            After the exercise, we organized our ideas into a feature prioritization matrix. We landed on two key features that will be the focus during the development of Recipe Genie. </p>

          <h1 class="display-4">FUTURE IDEAS</h1>
          <p class="lead">In this prototype, we emphasized the "use existing ingredients" feature. In future iterations, we plan to introduce a dedicated section for users to access detailed nutritional information, including ingredient sources. This aligns with our overarching goal of revolutionizing recipe management and tailoring meal plans to meet all user nutritional preferences. This concept is driven by valuable user feedback from our initial interviews, such as, "When choosing a recipe, I check to see if it is quick and if they have the right ingredients."</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">CONCLUSION</h1>
          <p class="lead">Recipe Genie has evolved from concept to a high-fidelity prototype, shaped by user-centered design principles. Our iterative process, guided by the goals of revolutionizing recipe management, enhancing cooking experiences, and simplifying meal planning, has refined the app's features based on valuable user feedback. As we move forward, Recipe Genie remains committed to empowering users with nutritional information and continually adapting to meet their evolving needs, making meal planning and cooking more accessible and enjoyable for all.</p>

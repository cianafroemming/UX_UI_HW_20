          <p class="lead">We interviewed five individuals who cook nightly to understand their meal prep, shopping habits, and pain points. Each individual was asked the same 20 questions, divided into three objectives.</p>
          <ul class="user-interviews">
            <li>Identify the app's target users</li>
            <li>Assess how users currently analyze ingredient information and its importance to them.</li>

          <p class="lead">Drawing from insights gathered during user research, the “I Like, I Want, I Wish” exercise helped us brainstorm app features tailored to meet user needs and aspirations in meal planning and cooking.
            After the exercise, we organized our ideas into a feature prioritization matrix. We landed on two key features that will be the focus during the development of Recipe Genie. </p>
          <ul class="I LIKE">
            <li>I wish I could find recipes that aligned with ingredients in my house.</li>
            <li>What if recipes could build a tailored shopping list.</li>
